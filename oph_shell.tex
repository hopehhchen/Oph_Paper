\begin{abstract}
\cite{Arce_2010} identified shells driven by B- or later type stars in Perseus, and found that the energy input from these shell structures is comparable to the total turbulent energy in the Perseus molecular cloud. Using a combination of data from Herschel, Planck, 2MASS and FCRAO molecular line observations, we identify and study a similar shell structure in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud. The shell is centered at a B-type star, $\rho$ Ophiuchi, and is potentially the result of the stellar wind driven by $\rho$ Oph. We find that the energy entrained in the shell contributes to $\sim$15\% of the turbulent energy in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud.

\section{Introduction} 
Stars go through many periods of mass loss throughout their lives. Young embedded protostars drive powerful collimated outflows, and as they evolve, the mass loss rate decreases and the outflows become less collimated \citep{Bontemps_1996,Arce_2006}. Wide-angle winds, sometimes coexistent with a more collimated, jet-like component, are observed around evolved pre-main sequence stars (T-Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars). It was realized early on in the study of winds that both the outflows driven by protostars and winds from T-Tauri stars have the potential to significantly affect the dynamics and structure of the parent cloud \citep{Norman_1980}, and the impact has been observed and analysed by \cite{Arce_2006} and \citet{Arce_2010}. However, the original bubble model proposed by \citet{Norman_1980} lost its appeal when T-Tauri stars were more often observed to have an effect on their surroundings through what are now well-known bipolar outflows.

However, parsec-scale circular cavities (typically referred to as ``shells'' or ``bubbles'') are regularly found in regions of high-mass star formation, and are likely created by spherical winds from high-mass stars \citep{Churchwell_2006,Churchwell_2007,Beaumont_2010}. High-mass stars evolve faster than low-mass stars, and they reach the main sequence while they are still accreting material and embedded in their parent cloud. Mass loss rates of $\sim$$10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ that can create these bubbles have been observed around high-mass stars during their main sequence phase. Previously, it was thought that the same process did not happen in regions of intermediate- and/or low-mass star formation. However, \citet{Arce_2011} find that in the Perseus cloud it is possible, and frequent, for B or later types of main sequence stars and evolved pre-main sequence stars to drive spherical winds that can have a significant impact on the natal cloud. In their estimates of the impact, comparisons between the energy entrained in these shells and the turbulent energy in the cloud show that the embedded stellar winds have enough energy to disturb the cloud and contribute to the turbulence therein.

Reliable estimates of density and  dynamics are critical to measuring the significance of wind-cloud interactions. \citet{Goodman_2009} find that mass estimates can vary significantly due to biases inherent to various techniques for measuring column density in molecular clouds, including near-infrared extinction, mid/far-infrared thermal emission and molecular line emission.  These uncertainties and biases in mass determination can lead to similarly uncertain and/or biased estimates of momentum and energy.  \citet{Goodman_2009} find that not only do different types of observations trace different components (e.g. warm/cold gas/dust) in molecular clouds, but they also have sensitivity limits that are different from one another. These limits are dependent on the physical environment, and extreme care should be taken extreme when using (any of) these tracers to estimate the density and other physical properties.

%The recent release of data taken by the Herschel Space Observatory has inspired many works examining the validity and caveats of using far-infrared thermal emission in estimates of column density. One of the most discussed issues is the artificial anti-correlation between the temperature and the emissivity spectral index that can be caused by (even small amounts of) noise in real data, when certain fitting procedures are used. The boost of computational power and new algorithms in the past decade has allowed researchers to use parameter-estimation techniques that are less likely to cause false correlations amongst fitted parameters.  \citet{Kelly_2012} have proposed a hierarchical Bayesian-fitting method and tested it on  Herschel data, and they claim that the Bayesian procedure (as opposed to least-squares fitting) reduces (false) temperature-opacity anti-correlation when fitting models for thermal dust emission at multiple wavelengths.

In this paper we focus on an embedded stellar wind in one of the most near-by molecular clouds: Ophiuchus. A shell structure is found around a group of B-stars ($\rho$ Oph; \S2). Multi-wavelength observations are used in our analysis of this shell. These include near-infrared data from the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS), far-infrared maps from Planck the Herschel Space Observatory and $^{12}$CO (1-0) and $^{13}$CO (1-0) line data taken at Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO) from the COoridnated Molecular Probe Line Emission Thermal Emission \citep[COMPLETE;]{Ridge_2006} project (\S3). These diverse data sets allow us to make a holistic study of the shell in terms of dust temperature and column density ($\S$4), as well as molecular emission. We conclude with an estimate of the impact caused by the embedded stellar wind (\S5). Our result reconfirms the idea proposed by \citet{Arce_2011} that stellar winds driven by B or even later types of stars can contribute to the turbulence in molecular clouds.

\section{Target}
The Ophiuchus cloud is one of the closest molecular clouds, at a distance of $119 \pm 6$ pc \citep{Lombardi_2008}. It hosts a few star forming regions, including the well-studied $\rho$ Oph cluster. Fig. 1 shows the entire Ophiuchus cloud at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths, as well as the $^{12}$CO line emission and H$\alpha$ emission. A shell-like structure can be identified at infrared wavelengths and in the molecular line observations. The H$\alpha$ emission appears in a filled circular shape that fits in the interior of the shell. The center of both the shell and the H$\alpha$ emission coincides with the position of $\rho$ Ophiuchii, which is a group of B-type stars. The shell-like structure, the H$\alpha$ emission and its proximity to B-stars all indicate that the shell is driven by an embedded stellar wind. 

$\rho$ Ophiuchii \citep[16h 25m 35.12s, -23d 26m 49.82s, J2000,]{van_Leeuwen_2007}, not to be confused with the YSO cluster of the same name lying more than a degree to the south, is a neighborhood of five B-type stars \citep{Cordiner_2013}. It includes two pairs of close binaries ($\rho$ Oph AB and $\rho$ Oph DE, at 111$^{+12}_{-10}$ pc and 135$^{+12}_{-10}$ pc respectively) and a single star at the northern edge of the neighborhood ($\rho$ Oph C, at $\sim$ 125$^{+14}_{-11}$ pc). The distances of $\rho$ Oph and the Ophiuchus molecular cloud indicate that at least $\rho$ Oph C is embedded in the cloud, if not all five B-stars considering the uncertainties of the distance measurements.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
In this paper, we use data from the COordinated Molecular Probe Line Extinction Thermal Emission (COMPLETE) Survey of Star Forming Regions. Together with auxiliary data sets, these include 1) an extinction map based on photometry from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) and a near-infrared color excess method, the NICEST algorithm \citep[][note that this is an improved version of the NICER algorithm and is developed after the COMPLETE Survey]{Lombardi_2009}, 2) observations of the $^{12}$CO J=1-0 and $^{13}$CO J=1-0 molecular line emission obtained at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO) 3) the 6$'$ FWHM thermal dust emission model of \cite{Meisner_2015}, based on Planck and IRAS observations between 100$\mu$m and 100 GHz 4) archival Herschel data from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey \citep{Andre_2010}. Our combination of a Planck-based thermal dust model with high-resolution Herschel data allows us to derive column density at Herschel 500$\mu$m resolution while retaining the reliable zero level of Planck.

\subsection{2MASS/NICEST Extinction}
The NICEST algorithm is the latest version of a near-infrared color excess method to derive dust extinction based on near-infrared stellar photometry from 2MASS \citep{Lombardi_2009}. Its predecessors include the NICE and the NICER algorithms \citep{Lombardi_2001,Lombardi_2005}. The NICEST extinction maps have angular resolution of $1'$ FWHM.

\subsection{Herschel Data}
\label{sec:herschel_data}
The Herschel Space Observatory was a satellite operated by the European Space Agency. Its Photodetecting Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) and Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) covered wavelengths from 55 to 670 $\mu$m, with six broad spectral bands identified by their nominal central wavelengths: PACS 70$\mu$m, 100$\mu$m, and 160$\mu$m and SPIRE 250$\mu$m, 350$\mu$m, and 500$\mu$m. A wide range of the Herschel data products is available in the Herschel Science Archive. In this paper, we use data that were obtained as part of the Herschel Gould Belt Survey \citep{Andre_2010}. The maps presented in this paper are produced in the Herschel Interactive Processing Environment (HIPE; Version 11.1.0 was used to produce these maps). Note that in this study, we only make use of Herschel mosaics at 160$\mu$m, 250$\mu$m, 350$\mu$m and 500$\mu$m. The Herschel mosaics at these wavelengths allow us to study a large $\sim$25 square degree region of Ophiuchus, while the  corresponding PACS 100$\mu$m footprint covers roughly an order of magnitude less sky area, and PACS 70$\mu$m probes a different population of dust grains than do the longer wavelength bands (see discussion of $\S$\ref{sec:fir_modeling}).

\subsection{Molecular Line Emission: $^{12}$CO (1-0) and $^{13}$CO (1-0)}
Observations of molecular line emission of the $^{12}$CO J=1-0 and $^{13}$CO J=1-0 transitions were carried out at the 14m Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory \citep[FCRAO;]{Ridge_2006}. The SEQUOIA 32-element focal-plane array was used to make an on-the-fly map of the Ophiuchus region. A total bandwidth of 25 MHz with 1024 channels in each IF in the dual-IF mode yielded an effective velocity resolution of 0.07 km s$^{-1}$. This allows us to resolve subsonic velocity structures in a typical molecular cloud environment \citep[with a temperature of 15 K and an average molecular weight of 2.33 m$_H$;]{Carey_1998,Pillai_2006}.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}
Figure 1 shows the column densities based on the data described in Section \ref{sec:data}. For comparison, column densities are converted to the unit of V-band extinction (A$_V$) using a uniform conversion factor of N(H$_2$)/A$_V$ = 6.9 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ mag$^{-1}$ \citep{Draine_2003,Evans_2009}. (Different factors were suggested for more diffuse regions, for example, N(H$_2$)/A$_V$ = 9.4 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ mag$^{-1}$ by \citet{Bohlin_1978}.) For the 2MASS/NICEST extinction map, we assume a linear reddening law of A$_K$/A$_V$ = 0.114. Besides the column density, other physical properties including the temperature are derived from these data based on respective assumptions described as follows.

\subsection{Herschel Zero Level}
\label{sec:zero_level}
Although Herschel PACS/SPIRE imaging offers superb angular resolution, the Herschel mosaics described in $\S$\ref{sec:herschel_data} are not absolutely calibrated, in the sense that there may be a per-band additive offset needed to correct the Herschel zero level. This issue has traditionally been addressed for small $\lesssim$1 square degree regions by adding a scalar offset to the Herschel mosaic under consideration at each wavelength. However, in this study we seek to calibrate Herschel data for a large region of the Ophiuchus cloud dozens of square degrees in size. Over this sizeable footprint, we found that a single per-band scalar offset could not satisfactorily correct the Herschel zero level.

Instead, we chose to allow for a spatially varying zero level offset in each Herschel band. Specifically, we used the \cite{Meisner_2015} Planck-based thermal dust emission model to predict the Herschel emission at 10$'$ FWHM over our entire Ophiuchus footprint. These low-resolution Herschel predictions incorporated color corrections to account for the Herschel bandpasses. To correct the Herschel zero level, we then high-pass filtered each Herschel mosaic at $10$$'$, and replaced the low-order spatial modes ($\geq$10$'$ FWHM) with the corresponding Planck-based predictions. We thereby achieved dust emission maps at 160$\mu$m, 250$\mu$m, 350$\mu$m, 500$\mu$m which retain the high angular resolution of Herschel, but inherit the reliable zero level of Planck.

\subsection{Herschel Dust SED Fitting}
\label{sec:fir_modeling}
We assume that the Herschel maps from 160$\mu$m to 500$\mu$m, following the zero level corrections of $\S$\ref{sec:zero_level}, are dominated by ``big grain \citep[BG;][]{Stepnik_2003}'' thermal dust emission. We also assume that the thermal dust emission can be described by a single modified blackbody (MBB). This assumption is only valid under certain conditions and becomes inaccurate at wavelengths shorter than 100$\mu$m due to contamination from ``very small grain'' (VSG) emission. Adopting a single-component modified blackbody model also presumes that the material along the line of sight has a single temperature. We adopt a spatially constant value of $\beta$=1.71 for the MBB emissivity power law index, based on the median value of the \cite{Planck_2014} $\beta$ map over our Ophiuchus footprint.

Prior to SED fitting, we smooth the Herschel maps at 160$\mu$m, 250$\mu$m and 350$\mu$m to 36.1$'$ FWHM, to match the angular resolution of the SPIRE 500$\mu$m map. To perform the actual SED fits, we consider the SED comprised of four Herschel broadband SED measurements (at 160$\mu$m, 250$\mu$m, 350$\mu$m, and 500$\mu$m) in each pixel independently. We assume a 10\% fractional uncertainty on each Herschel intensity measurement. The model parameters we allow to vary during SED fitting are the dust temperature, which dictates the SED shape, and the SED normalization at 350$\mu$m, which dictates the SED amplitude. For each pixel, we then derive the optimal temperature and 350$\mu$m intensity via simple $\chi^2$ minimization. Using the equation $I_{\nu}$=$\tau_{\nu}$$B_{\nu}(T)$, we can then derive the optical depth at any frequency based on our two fitted parameters. Our results are shown for the shell region of particular interest in Figure \ref{fig:herschel_shell}.

The single-MBB, $\chi^2$ minimization approach employed here is traditional, but not necessarily optimal. In particular, many variants of the fitting procedure could be imagined, even given the same Herschel input maps. In particular, we could allow for a spatially varying $\beta$ and/or leverage more sophisticated inference techniques, such as that of \cite{Kelly_2012}, which properly handles the well-known $\beta$-$T$ anti-correlation. 

Figure \ref{fig:herschel_nicest} shows a log-log scatter plot of NICEST extinction versus our Herschel-based optical depth. Good agreement can be seen, especially over the
approximate range of 0.1$<$$A_V$$<$1 in extinction. However, the agreement is not perfect, particularly at high extinction $A_V$$\gtrsim$1. We defer a full, detailed comparison of multiple methods by which to derive dust and gas column densities throughout the entire Ophiuchus molecular cloud to a future work (Chen et al., in preparation).

\caption{\label{fig:herschel_nicest} Log-log scatter plot of NICEST extinction ($A_v$) versus our Herschel-based $\tau_{350\mu m}$ over the entire Ophiuchus region, after regridding to the NICEST pixelization. Across a wide range of $A_V$, approximately 0.1$<$$A_V$$<$1, there is a very strong and nearly linear correlation. However, the 
agreement is not perfect, particularly at high extinction, $A_V$$\gtrsim$1. More specifically, the best-fit log-log slope over the range in $\tau_{350\mu m}$ indicated by the vertical green lines is 1.10, suggesting that the relationship between NICEST $A_V$ and Herschel optical depth is close to, but not exactly linear.}
\end{figure}

%\citet{Schnee_2007} examined this effect and gave an estimate of error for a similar method to derive the column density and dust temperature. They conluded that the typical error at 60 $\mu$m is around 20\% and smaller for longer wavelengths.

\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{FCRAO Molecular Line Emission}
We follow the analysis in \citet{Pineda_2008} to derive the equivalent V-band extinction from the $^{12}$CO (1-0) and $^{13}$CO (1-0) line observations. We start by assuming that the $^{12}CO$ is optically thick. We then calculate the excitation temperature using the main beam temperature at the peak of $^{12}CO$:

\begin{equation}
T_{\text{ex}} = \frac{5.5\,\text{[K]}}{\ln{\left(1+5.5\,\text{[K]}/\left(T_{\text{max}}(^{12}\text{CO})+0.82\,\text{[K]}\right)\right)}}\;\;\;\text{,}
\end{equation}

where $T_{\text{max}}(^{12}\text{CO})$ is the brightness temperature at the peak. If the excitation temperature of the $^{13}CO$ (1-0) line is the same as the $^{12}CO$ (1-0), we can calculate the optical depth of the $^{13}CO$ (1-0) line:

\begin{equation}
\tau(^{13}\text{CO}) = - \ln\left[1 - \frac{T_{\text{max}}(^{13}\text{CO})/5.3\,\text{[K]}}{1/\left(e^{5.3\,\text{[K]}/T_{\text{ex}}}-1\right) - 0.16}\right]
\end{equation}

Similarly, here $T_{\text{max}}(^{12}\text{CO})$ is the main beam brightness temperature at the peak of $^{13}CO$. Using the definition of column density in Rohlfs \& Wilson (1996), we can derive the $^{13}CO$ column density from the two equations above:

\begin{equation}
N(^{13}\text{CO}) = 3.0\times10^{14}\;\left[\frac{\tau(^{13}\text{CO})}{1-e^{-\tau(^{13}\text{CO})}}\right]\,\frac{W(^{13}\text{CO})}{1-e^{-5.3\,\text{[K]}/T_{\text{ex}}}}\;\text{[cm}^{-2}\text{]}\;\;\;\text{,}
\end{equation}

where $W(^{13}\text{CO})$ is the integrated intensity along the line of sight in units of [K km/s]. Similarly, we then fit the conversion from both $N(^{13}\text{CO})$ and $W(^{13}\text{CO})$ to the 2MASS extinction.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
A_V &= X_{N(^{13}\text{CO})}\,N(^{13}\text{CO}) \\
A_V &= X_{W(^{13}\text{CO})}\,W(^{13}\text{CO})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Energy/Momentum Estimation}
To estimate the contribution of the embedded B-star wind to the turbulence in the Ophiuchus, we use the {\it Herschel} far-infrared emission for the mass calculation (see \S4 for detailed discussion) and the molecular line emission for the velocity calculation. To estimate the mass, {\it Herschel} 350$\mu$m opacity is assumed to be linearly correlated with 2MASS near-infrared extinction, in logarithmic space. On the other hand, the resolution of molecular line observation allows us to derive velocity dispersion in the cloud and the expansion motion of the shell. A foreground/background correction equivalent to 0.6 magnitude of V-band extinction is applied to the data (Lombardi et al.\ 2015) throughout this section.

\begin{figure*}[ht]

\caption{The region used to calculate the shell properties in red, on top of the {\it Herschel} 350$\mu$m opacity and {\it Herschel}-based temperature.
}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{The Cloud}
The cloud boundary is defined using the column density contours equivalent to 1 and 5 magnitude of V-band extinction. The A$_V$ = 1 and 5 contours correspond to the thresholds used to define ``cloud component'' and ``dense material'' in Lombardi et al.\ (2010), respectively. For each pixel within the cloud boundary, we estimate the mass column density using the equation (Arce et al.\ 2001):

\begin{equation}
\Sigma = \mu\,N_{H_2} = \mu\,(9.4\times10^{20})A_V\;\text{g/cm}^2,
\end{equation}

where $\mu$ is the average mass per particle and is $\sim$ 2.72 times mass of a hydrogen atom (a.m.u.) for molecular clouds in our Milky Way (ref?). We then obtain the total mass by summing up the mass column density of all pixels within the cloud boundary ($M_{pixel} = \Sigma\times \text{Area}_{pixel}$; $M_{total} = \sum_{i}M_{pixel}$). Using the same equation, A$_V$ = 1 and 5 corresponds to number column densities of $9.35 \times 10^{20}$ and $4.68 \times 10^{21}$ cm $^{-2}$, respectively.

For Ophiuchus, we estimate the mass of the cloud and the dense component to be 5,535 M$_{\sun}$ and 1,808 M$_{\sum}$, using the boundary defined by A$_V$ = 1 and 5, respectively. The result is consistent with previous estimates of $\sim$ 6000 M$_{\sun}$, based on 2MASS extinction and other methods including one using the integrated molecular line emission.

The turbulent velocity of the cloud is estimated using the $^{12}$CO (1-0) line emission. Since the line profile in a molecular cloud at this scale varies from one part of the cloud to another, it is unsuitable to fit the profile and to calculate the velocity dispersion from the fit. A natural way to calculate the velocity dispersion is the second central moment:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_v = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\int{I(\mathbf{p}, v)\,(v(\mathbf{p}, v)-v_{cent}(\mathbf{p}))^2\,\text{d}(\mathbf{p}, v)}}{\int{I(\mathbf{p}, v)}\,\text{d}(\mathbf{p}, v)}\right)}\;\;\;\text{,}
\end{equation}

where $I(\mathbf{p}, v)$ and $v(\mathbf{p}, v)$ are the intensity and the velocity at each position $\mathbf{p}$ and velocity $v$, respectively. $v_{cent}(\mathbf{p})$ is the velocity centroid and is calculated from:

\begin{equation}
v_{cent} = \frac{\int{I(\mathbf{p}, v)\,v(\mathbf{p}, v)\,\text{d}(\mathbf{p}, v)}}{\int{I(\mathbf{p}, v)\,\text{d}(\mathbf{p}, v)}}
\end{equation}

This is also the first moment, which can be understood as the mean velocity weighted by the intensity at each velocity. In the data cube obtained at the FCRAO, the velocity resolution is 0.21 km/s, smaller than the typical thermal linewidth in molecular clouds ($\sim$ 1 km/s). Thus, we can use the discrete sum to calculate the integrals above without losing any information.

The average of the second central moment in the Ophiuchus cloud is $\sim$ 0.97 km/s. The rms velocity of the turbulence is $\sqrt{3}$ times the velocity dispersion and is thus $\sim$ 1.68 km/s on average over the cloud. To calculate the total momentum and energy in the turbulence, we match the maps of the second moment and the 2MASS/NICER extinction. We then calculate the momentum/energy within each pixel by using the extinction and the second moment at the pixel. For regions outside the coverage of the FCRAO observations, we adopt the mean second moment (0.97 km/s) for the turbulent velocity. Summing up the energy $E_i = 0.5\,M_i\,v_{turb,\,i}^2$ over the entire cloud gives us an estimate of the total momentum and energy in the turbulence. These are 9900 M$_{\sun}$ km/s and $8.82\times10^{46}$ erg, respectively.

\subsubsection{The Shell}
The ``bubble'' model (Silk 1985) of an embedded stellar wind predicts that we should observe a hot and relatively diffuse interior and a warm dense shell. In the case of the embedded stellar wind, the ``thickness'' of the shell is often much smaller than the radius of the shell (\citet{Churchwell_2007}; \citet{Arce_2011}), thus making the opacity of the shell smaller along lines of sight through the center of the shell. As a result, the projection of the shell on the sky often looks like a ``ring.'' Due to the variation of the density and the irregularity of the shape of the cloud, the ring is likely incomplete and asymmetric. Estimating mass from the column density within a projected area is thus a lower bound, and serves as a good proxy for the total mass of the shell when the shell is optically thin and symmetric. To estimate the mass of the shell, we first overlay the temperature and density maps to determine a region defined by circles concentric at $\rho$ Oph, the group of B-type stars. The region roughly corresponds to the warm and dense ring-shape component on the Herschel-based column density and temperature maps. To avoid confusion due to the dense gas in the L1688 region (the ``cluster''), we completely exclude the cluster region where active star forming material is mostly gravitationally bound. After this projected region of the shell is determined, we again use the Herschel 350$\mu$m opacity measurement to derive the column density, using Equation 5. Summing up every pixel within the shell region then gives us the shell mass, estimated to be 454 $M_{\sun}$. This is a lower bound, since the cluster region is excluded completely where the shell can contribute partially to the mass along the line of sight.

The expanding velocity of the shell is determined from the average spectrum of the shell. The symmetry of the shell predicts that the velocity we observe with the molecular line emission within the ``ring'' is symmetric around some system velocity. That is, for each ``particle'' in the shell, the velocity is determined by ($v_{system}$ + $v_{expansion}\,\sin{\left(\cos^{-1}{\left(R/R_0\right)}\right)}$ + $v_{intrinsic}$), where $v_{intrinsic}$ is drawn from a velocity distribution characteristic of the molecule's intrinsic (microscopic) motion. Assuming that the line emission from $^{12}$CO (1-0) traces the gas component of the shell and that the intrinsic velocity distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution, we find $v_{expansion}$ from the residual of fitting the $^{12}$CO line with $N(v_{system}, \sigma)$. Fig. 15 shows the residual as well as the fitted Gaussian line profile, with an asymmetry of the residual due the opacity. $v_{residual}$ is $\sim$ 1.2 km/s, which is $v_{expansion}\,\sin{\left(\cos^{-1}{\left(R/R_0\right)}\right)}$ in the equation above. With the shell mass region selected to have an inner radius $\sim$ 0.98 pc and an outer radius $\sim$ 1.61 pc, we find $v_{expansion}$ to be $\sim$ 1.52 km/s. Notice that $v_{residual}$ is a lower bound since the residual calculated from the $^{12}$CO (1-0) line profile is likely probing the gas component at a larger radius than the inner radius due to the opacity effect.

From these estimates, we obtain the momentum and the kinetic energy of the shell. These are given by $P_{shell} = M_{shell}\,v_{expansion}$ and $E_{shell} = 0.5\,M_{shell}\,v^2_{expansion}$, respectively. For this shell, the momentum is $\sim$ 702 $M_{\sun}\,km/s$, and the energy is $\sim$ $1.06\times10^{46}\,erg$. This is $\sim$ 12 \% of the total turbulent energy of the cloud (compared to $\sim$ 15 \% for the largest shell in Perseus; Fig. 16). Notice again that since the estimates for the mass and the expansion velocity are both the lower limits of possible values, the momentum and energy of the shell presented here are likely smaller than the real values as well.

\subsection{Impact of the Shell}
To estimate the impact of the shell on the cloud, we first compare the energy in the shell with the gravitational binding energy. With an effective radius of 5 pc (from the approximated geometrical mean of the cloud extent), we calculate the gravitational binding energy to be $3.97\times10^{47}$ erg, which is 30 times larger than the kinetic energy in the shell. Clearly, the shell does not have the energy to unbind the entire cloud.

One way to assess whether or not the embedded stellar wind is powerful enough to drive the turbulence is by comparing the energy injection rate ($\dot E_W$) of the shell to the turbulence dissipation rate ($L_{turb}$). The intuitive way to estimate the energy injection rate of the shell is to assume a timescale during which the wind from the embedded B-stars has been accumulating the kinetic energy that we observe within the shell. Following Arce et al. (2011), we assume $\tau_W$ $\sim$ $1\times10^6$ yr. We then have $\dot E_W = E_{shell}/\tau_W \sim 3.4\times10^{33}$ erg/s. Another way to assess this is following Eq. 3.7 in \citet{McKee_1989}:

\begin{equation}
\dot E_W = 0.5\,(\dot M_W\,v_W)\,v_{rms}\;\;\;\text{,}
\end{equation}

where $v_{rms}$ is the rms velocity of the turbulence in the cloud. $\dot M_W$ and $v_W$ are the mass loss rate and the wind velocity respectively. The mass loss rate of the shell can be estimated from the shell momentum we calculated in \S5.1 by assuming $\tau_W$ and a wind velocity $v_W$.

\begin{equation}
\dot M_W = \frac{P_{shell}}{\tau_W\,v_W}
\end{equation}

Assuming $\tau_W$ $\sim$ $6\times10^6$ yr and $v_W$ $\sim$ 200 km/s, we get a mass loss rate $\dot M_W$ $\sim$ $2.3\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\sun}$/yr. With the rms velocity of the turbulence $\sim$ 1.68 km/s, we get an energy injection rate of $\sim$ $10^{33}$ erg/s.

The turbulence dissipation rate depends on the dissipation time, which is related to the free-fall time and is often written as $t_{diss} = \eta\,t_{ff}$. In \citet{McKee_1989} and McLow (1999), numerical simulations give $\eta$ in the range of 1 to 10. Assuming $\eta$ = 5 and a volume density of $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$, we have $t_{diss}$ $\sim$ $5\times10^6$ yr. We can then calculate the turbulence dissipation rate:

\begin{equation}
L_{turb} = \frac{E_{turb}}{t_{diss}}
\end{equation}

This gives $L_{turb}$ $\sim$ $10^{33}$ erg/s, which is on the same order of magnitude as the energy injection rate of the shell. These estimates indicate that the spherical wind from B-stars ($\rho$ Oph) has the potential for driving the turbulence in the Ophiuchus cloud. This result agrees with \citet{Arce_2011}.

\subsection{Comparing to Perseus}
Table 1 shows the physical properties of the shell discussed here and the largest shell (CPS 5) in the Perseus (\citet{Arce_2011}). We find that while the momenta of the two shells are comparable, the shell in the Ophiuchus cloud is more massive with a lower expansion velocity. This results in its smaller kinetic energy. However, since the total energy in the turbulence is smaller in the Ophiuchus cloud, the ratios of the shell energy to the turbulence energy in the cloud are comparable to each other. In the comparison of the energy injection rate and the turbulence dissipation rate, the shell in the Ophiuchus is powerful enough to drive the turbulence by itself, while in the Perseus, all shells with confidence scores larger than 4 (\citet{Arce_2011}) are required to get an energy injection rate at the same order of magnitude as the turbulence dissipation rate. We think that this hints at the fundamental difference between the two clouds and the shell(s) therein. The Ophiuchus cloud is slightly smaller than the Perseus cloud in terms of its mass and size, and the larger mass/smaller velocity of the shell in the Ophiuchus cloud probably indicates that the shell has been expanding for a longer period of time.

\section{Conclusions}
In this work, multi-wavelength observations enable us to analyse the derivation of physical properties in the interstellar medium. By doing this, we provide a reliable estimate of the energy and momentum in the cloud and the shell-like structure of an embedded B-star wind. We find that, although this one shell is not powerful enough to sustain the turbulence in the entire cloud, it does inject a substantial amount of energy into the cloud. Here we list our conclusions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Three of the most common ways to trace the column density in molecular clouds include the near-infrared extinction, mid/far-infrared thermal emission and molecular line emission. Comparing the results using data from 2MASS, Herschel and FCRAO, we find that the 2MASS/NICER-based extinction measurement serves as the most reliable tracer of column densities in the cloud. However, each of these different tracers, including the 2MASS/NICER-based extinction, suffers from its own limits. This is because none of these tracers directly trace the most dominant component of mass in molecular clouds: the molecular hydrogen. The variation of dust-to-gas ratio and the dust properties affect the effectiveness of both dust tracers, while the excitation criterion (for example, the critical density and temperature) makes it difficult to assess the conversion from the line emission to the gas column density. In dense regions, the molecular line emission can be optically thick or depleted, making it unsuitable for tracing the column density. Following \citet{Goodman_2009}, we propose that when choosing tracers of the column density, one should always consider the physical environment of the target region. 
\item With a better understanding of various density tracers, we calculate the total turbulent energy in the Ophiuchus cloud and the energy entrained in the embedded B-star wind. By comparing the two, we find that the energy in the shell strucuture caused by the B-star wind amounts to $\sim$ 12 \% of the total turbulent energy in the cloud. The wind's energy injection rate is also comparable to the dissipation rate of the turbulent energy in the entire cloud. Comparing this result to shells in the Perseus cloud (Arce et al. 2011), we find that the shell in the Ophiuchus has energy comparable to the largest few shells in the Perseus and its energy injection rate is comparable to the \emph{sum} of all shells in the Perseus. We conclude that the embedded stellar winds can contribute to the turbulent energy in molecular clouds. In future simulations, embedded winds driven by B or even later types of stars should be included as important sources of turbulence in molecular clouds.
